1. Cors - Is necessary to communicate simultaneously with the FE and BE server. For further information, click this [link](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing).
Next you should install install the [CORS](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi) browser plug-in for chrome.

2. The Server has to be set up and started from another console.
- So run also npm install inside of the Server package
- run server with node server.js or npm run dev (in dev mode)

3. MongoDB has to run locally with path data/db

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
